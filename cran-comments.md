# CRAN notes for gtfsrouter_0.1.4 submission

The current CRAN version generates NOTEs on some systems regarding large sizes of both "docs" and "libs" directories. These are unavoidable, as the package contains a large C++ code base, and also requires extensive documentation. The "docs" folders contain only 4 images generated by "ggplot2", which are relatively simple and already as small as possible in size.

Other than that, this submission generates no additional notes or warnings on:

* Ubuntu 24.04: R-oldrelease, R-release, R-devel
* Windows: R-release
* Mac-OS: R-release
* win-builder (R-release, R-devel, R-oldrelease)

C++ source code in package also generates no warnings with Clang++ -Weverything
